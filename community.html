                    nurseries and kindergarten. Pre-school, which is optional, is followed by nine years of <br>
                    compulsory education in primary and lower secondary school. There is an optional tenth form.<br>
                    The upper secondary education system includes a range of opportunities. Academic <br>
                    programmes allow students to apply for entry to higher education. Vocational programmes are<br>
                    aimed at direct entry to the labour market.</p>

                    state. These are just three of the reasons why many foreigners want to come to Denmark. In <br>
                    recent years, Denmark has attracted foreign workers in a wide range of areas, and the <br>
                    expectation is that in the future even more foreigners who are willing to be part of the Danish <br>
                    work force and society will be needed.</p>

                <p class="content">in order to rent a property in Denmark, you will generally be expected to pay a deposit <br>
                    amounting up to 3 months rent, by bank transfer. Do not pay the deposit by cash, because you <br>
                    can't prove the the payment if anything goes wrong. Unless you are using a specialist rental <br>
                    agency dealing with short-term lets to expatriates, the minimum lease is generally one year. <br>
                    Furthermore you should note that you often have to pay 2 to 3 months rent in advance, but the <br>
                    agreement differs depending on the landlord. Remember always to read to contract thoroughly.</p>
                <p class="content2">Houses are more common towards the suburbs. Many apartment blocks are old and do not<br>
                    have lifts. Ground floor apartments are the cheapest, and the price usually increases the <br>
                    higher you go, with top floor being the most sought after. Many new developments are being<br>
                    built in the Amager area.
